# Password Factory
A password maker that takes your lame password and turns it into a awesome password

It will ask for an everyday password for example "adam123", "scruffyIsCool", "irox1997" which can be cracked in a matter of seconds.
Then it will ask for the length and a key to use so that all you have to do is remember the master password and key.
Rather than have to remember the whole password you can use this program, a piece of paper with the length and key and remember your basic master password.

For example<br>
If i use the password *adam1997* I know that it is pretty weak.
[How Secure Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) states it will take 1 minute to brute force which is pretty bad.<br>
So if I use my basic password with a key of "cookies" and a length of 20, I get this *adam19972f0030c53519*, which takes 11 Trillion years to brute force. This makes it so much easier to remember especially when you change passwords regularly. Just change the key to "cookies2" which would result in *adam19977f4acb3a5d86* which is a whole new password.
